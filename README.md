## Summary

The sole purpose of this Web App, was to learn Django Framework with React for the client side and Material UI for layout etc.. I got the chance to explore how M.V.C (Model View Controller) works and recognize it's pattern. Therefore, organizing and separating data into it's own files, optimizing solutions to bugs/errors. In addition, one concept that i had difficulty understanding at first was "Serializers", which in short just serialize Python data into JSON Data. I really enjoyed and had fun how Django handles requests/responses from/to client/server which made easier separating React and API routes as well as enabling CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) to a specific URL. Although at first it took me quite some time to grasp the power Django Framework has to offer and still there are some concepts that i still want to explore and learn. Below you will see the technologies used for this application.
